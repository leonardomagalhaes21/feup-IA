# FEUP-IA: Artificial Intelligence Projects

This repository contains two artificial intelligence projects developed for the AI course at FEUP (Faculty of Engineering, University of Porto).

## Projects Overview

### [Project 1: Seating Arrangement Optimizer](Project1/README.md)
An intelligent seating arrangement system that optimizes guest placement at tables for events using various AI optimization algorithms.

**Key Features:**
- Multiple optimization algorithms (Genetic Algorithm, Hill Climbing, Simulated Annealing, etc.)
- Interactive visualization of seating arrangements
- Performance comparison between algorithms
- Support for different dataset sizes
- Real-time happiness score calculation

### [Project 2: Diabetes Prediction System](Project2/README.md)
A machine learning project that predicts diabetes risk based on patient health indicators using classification algorithms.

**Key Features:**
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Multiple classification models
- Model performance evaluation and comparison
- Interactive Jupyter notebook analysis
- Visualization of prediction results
